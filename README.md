# Carlos Rivas - CMST-101 Honors Project
#### A project for my public speaking course at UAB.

# Purpose
This web app is intended to reflect my current most valued social identities. In the course, we learned that we each have certain social identities that we feel proud of. I want to display my current social identities in this web app so that in the future I can look back and see what my social identities were in the year 2021.

# Time Capsule
This app is intended to be a time capsule so I can re-discover my past social identities. Since I consider my social identities to be dynamic, I am certain in the next few years my most valued social identities will be different than what they are now. I will be able to look back and see what they were today with this app.
