# Purpose
In the course, we learned that all of us have certain social identities that we feel proud of. This web app is intended to reflect my current most valued social identities (as of early 2021).

# Time Capsule
This web app is intended to be a time capsule holding my most valued social identities as of early 2021. I consider my social identities to be dynamic, so I expect them to change in the distant future. This app will allow me to re-discover my past social identities in a future time when I don't recall what I valued the most when I was younger.
